Saturday Work
=
First is the first, I need to skirt the issue of why my computer locks
up and runs into shit problems with my current state of rspec. Then, it's
off to fagging out in Mountain View for the afternoon and a movie later at
night

Attempt #1: Disable the sqlite-hitting tests
=
## Hypothesis: Whatever is causing the lock originates from hitting the sql
  lite database, thus disabling it should eliminate the lockdowns

## Procedure: Gonna run the tests 50 times with sqlite disabled and see if
  it locks up.

## Results: After running it for maybe 15 times, there were no lock ups and
  I got tremendously bored by the retarded repetition. Time to move on. As
  the case is, it is apparently sqlite fucking up.

## Solution 1: Try setting the value of record_model back to nil explicitly

## Hypothesis: Setting the record_model back to nil will cause the code to go
  back to using the defaults to find the record model (well, I KNOW it will do
  that, but I just want to test if the descrepenacy in setting that global state
  was the core problem)
