Another Day
=
Woke up a lot later than usual today, but decided to eat a healthy breakfast
and whatnot before heading out anyway. Thus is the consequence of living far
from where I work and essentially being forced to constantly deal with
previously incurred technical debt at a rather shitty work environment

On Cinco de LinkedIN
=
Went to LinkedIn's 10th anniversay celebration thing yesterday. Too much to
drink, too much to eat, but extremely fun nonetheless.
